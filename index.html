  <h1 data-splitting>Recruiting and Retaining Poll Workers to Reach 1 Million Poll Workers by 2024</h1>
  <p class="note1" style="color: teal;"> By Sam Zannotti, Jared Valuzzi, and Callie Krosin </p>
  <p>Poll workers are the unsung heroes who ensure the smooth functioning of elections. These individuals are key to safeguarding the integrity of elections, facilitating the exercise of citizens' fundamental right to vote, and upholding the principles of democracy.</p>
  <p>Recent data has shown a growing crisis: the shortage of poll workers. This includes temporary staff brought on to do the hands-on work for every election. They include greeters at polling places, ballot counters, foreign language interpreters, warehouse workers, and supervisors.</p>

<p>Experienced poll workers play a vital role in election management, yet the challenges of recruiting and keeping them have intensified in recent cycles. With the upcoming election, the shortage of poll workers is already causing panic and chaos in some states. Less than one month before Nevada’s presidential primaries earlier this year, poll worker positions in some countries remained unfilled, according to the Secretary of State’s office. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/document_library/files/2020_EAVS_Report_Final_508c.pdf" style="color: teal;">Election Assistance Commision</a> reports in the 2020 election, there were 132,556 polling places nationwide staffed by 775,101 poll workers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.powerthepolls.org/impact" style="color: teal">Power The Polls</a> is an nonpartisan initiative to recruit the next generation of poll workers to ensure safe and fair elections for all voters. The organization tracked just under 600 jurisdictions nationwide–about 10% of all jurisdictions in the country–according to Marta Hanson, the Power the Polls' National Program Manager. In 2024, the group “is monitoring poll worker needs in triple that number of jurisdictions. So we are seeing much higher needs.”</p>
<p> The issue at hand is that there are not enough poll workers to support the demand of the upcoming presidential election. Issues such as insufficient pay, partisan balance mandates, and harassment and threats have led to this scarcity. As a result, states face security risks, and even closures of polling locations. The implications of this shortage are less polling locations and longer wait times, a potential diversion for voters, along with other election administrative and access problems.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-poll-workers" style="color: teal;"> National Conference of State Legislatures</a>, in some places poll workers make up 70% of election office budgets. Poll worker wages are little, as reflected in this country-wide problem. Each state chooses how they pay their poll workers and at what age they can hire poll workers. Some states hire kids between the ages of 15 and 16 while others hire at 18. </p>
<p>In 13 states poll workers make a stipend of less than $100 per day. These days are long hours, so they make less than the typical minimum wage. Eleven states pay poll workers the same amount as minimum wage workers would make. These states see their poll workers just as valuable as any other minimum wage job. In 18 states and D.C. There is no wage set for poll workers, and the state's elected officials determine each worker's compensation as they see fit.</p>

<h1 data-splitting>SOLUTIONS IN PLACE</h1>

  <p>A variety of organizations and statewide initiatives have been established throughout the past few years to increase attention and draw in potential poll workers.</p>

  <h1 data-splitting class="note20"> GROUPS RECRUITING POLL WORKERS</h1>
<!--!
  <h1 data-splitting> <code>transition</code> to your splits (<code>.char</code> for example)</h1>
-->
<p>The NFL has publicly backed Vet the Vote. According to a NFL press release, Vet the Vote is a “pro-democracy non-partisan coalition of twenty-three veteran and military service organizations, five civic groups, Power the Polls, the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, and the National Football League (NFL) whose goal is to recruit 100,000 veterans and family members to serve as new poll workers.”</p>
<p>The NFL has publicly backed <a href="https://operations.nfl.com/updates/football-ops/vet-the-vote-recruits-its-36-000th-election-poll-worker/" style="color: teal;"> Vet the Vote</a>. According to a NFL press release, Vet the Vote is a “pro-democracy non-partisan coalition of twenty-three veteran and military service organizations, five civic groups, Power the Polls, the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, and the National Football League (NFL) whose goal is to recruit 100,000 veterans and family members to serve as new poll workers.” </p>
<p>Marta Hanson, Power the Polls' National Program Manager, works with a variety of groups other than Vet the Vote to help reach the goal of mobilizing a million people. Power the Polls is working with the campus vote project, inviting college students to be poll workers, and working with faith communities, and advocacy organizations. These groups receive robust materials, toolkits, and talking points to help them encourage their members to be poll workers.</p>
<h1 data-splitting class="note20">STATE FUNDING</h1>
<p>Other current solutions include states asking for more money to be able to train and hire those they see fit. For instance, in South Carolina, the state election commission requested $3.2 million for training and technical support. In Arizona, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes requested an additional $4.2 million from the state’s general fund, including $1.6 million for the state’s <a href="https://issueone.org/articles/the-high-cost-of-high-turnover/" style="color: teal;" >“critical election workforce,”</a> which would allow Arizona to add employees for training and certifying election workers, according to Issue One.</p>
<p> Melody Lacy, a former poll worker in Richmond County, Georgia said “I believe it’s quite the honorable position. Everyone should apply. There should be no shortage of poll workers, there should be a lot of brave people willing to do it”. Former workers are hoping to inspire more to join, yet the pay is the main issue that is stopping so many from having this honor. </p>
<h1 data-splitting>MORE SOLUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT</h1>
<p>Some solutions that have yet to be attempted that may be more beneficial include making election day a national holiday, implementing national electronic payment for poll workers, and establishing a widespread youth polling worker program.</p>
<h1 data-splitting class="note20">MAKE ELECTION DAY A NATIONAL HOLIDAY </h1>
<p> A different twist that may help draw in potential voters, as well as poll workers, is to make voting day a national holiday so those with full-time jobs can take the day off. This would give many more people the ability to work the polls, and the temporary nature allows for extra income on top of their salary. 
<p>Former poll worker Elaine Rosander from San Bernardino County suggested that this solution could start at the county employee level, if they did a little bit of a better job reaching out. “In LA County and San Bernardino County, they go to their employees and ask them to be poll workers. They pay them their day’s pay for their regular county job and then they pay them on top of that to be a poll worker, Rosander said.</p>
<p>“So there’s a lot of incentive for a county employee to be a poll worker. But there’s not a lot of outreach for just a regular citizen to get involved,” Rosander added. </p>
<h1 data-splitting CLASS="note20"> IMPLEMENT NATIONAL ELECTRONIC PAYMENT FOR POLL WORKERS</h1>
<p>According to the National State Conference of Legislatures, poll worker pay can be complicated to manage due to different job responsibilities, roles, movement of workers prior to an election, and travel compensation. These factors complicate the use of physical checks, creating post-election work that delays payments. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/finding-and-keeping-qualified-poll-workers" style="color: teal;" >Broward County, Florida</a>, employees in the March 2023 municipal election were paid through Zelle. Implementing this system paid poll workers quickly and eliminated complications by paying through check. In 2024, Broward County plans to pay all its poll workers through Zelle. Ben Williams, Broward County’s director of election operations, expects that the poll workers in his county will be paid within two to three days of the election, rather than two to three weeks.</p>
<p>One message Marta Hanson utilizes to recruit pollworkers, is that the role “is a great way to get paid to support democracy.” Implementing country wide electronic payment programs for temporary workers will encourage more people due to its convenience and ease, accessibility, and adaptation to modern payment methods. </p>
<h1 data-splitting CLASS="note20">IMPLEMENT A WIDESPREAD YOUTH POLLING WORKER PROGRAM </h1>
<p>Tech fluent poll workers are one of the top requests Power the Polls gets nationwide from election administrators. “I'm talking about comfort using a tablet or iPad. And the reason this is important is that a lot of jurisdictions are transitioning how they run elections,” Hanson said.  </p>
<p>Youth poll worker programs are established in 45 states and the District of Columbia as a way for people younger than 18 to participate in Election Day. Thirty-two states allow youth 16 years and older to serve as poll workers. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, polling places benefit from these digital natives’ willingness to operate electronic poll books and other voting technology, and the young people gain valuable insight into the workings of democracy.</p>
<p>The five states that have no codified youth poll worker program: Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota and Washington, should implement a youth poll worker program. Youth programs encourage young citizens to engage in democracy, voting, registration and democracy, and engage workers for the future.</p>

<div class="page">
<h1 data-splitting>GETTING TO 1 MILLION POLL WORKERS</h1>
<p>As the backbone of our electoral process, poll workers uphold the integrity of elections, facilitate citizens' right to vote, and bolster democratic principles. This shortage reverberates across election administration, voter access, and democratic engagement. A few months away from a Presidential election, jurisdictions must work fast to meet poll worker needs.</p>
<p>It's imperative that the aforementioned solutions are promoted and implemented to address this pressing issue. Those currently in place, such as groups like Vet the Vote, and state funding for poll workers, and those that can continue to be implemented: such as making election day a national holiday, implementing national electronic payment for poll workers, and a country-wide polling worker program. </p>
<p>Ensuring that poll worker needs are met means voting locations don’t close and that voters don’t have to wait in long lines, or perhaps not vote at all. Democracy continues when the vital role of poll workers is recognized, supported, and filled by dedicated individuals committed to the democratic process.</p>
